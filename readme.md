# Atomic
Atomic is a simple small programming lang made for fun! built-on c#

# Features(right now):
- working ionizer (tokenizer) and a parser that can detect ions(tokens) and be able to know what is a statement what is an expression etc ☑️
- ability to do math 💯
- (latest addition) enviroments and vars! declared with ```set varname >> value``` declaring vars and assinging is WIP


# Features(i want):
- full basic working programming lang c# typescript golang f#(less to do more) inspired syntax
# trying atomic:
simply use the command in your terminal ```dotnet run``` to enter repl mode
(make sure you have dotnet-sdk installed and to exit press ```ctrl+c``` in your terminal)
or if you to read a file use ```dotnet run run {file}``` or pass this args using your debugger
and if you want to test it for dev reasons ```dotnet run run? {file}``` 
### if you are using a debugger and getting an error give invalid args (in vscode you can go to .vscode/launch.json and change ```args=[]``` to args=["random"]) (this is a bug i am too lazy to fix)

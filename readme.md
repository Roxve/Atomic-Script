# Features:
### this is list of avaliable features to help me on dev go to [website](https://atonix0.github.io/Atomic-Script) for overview, or to [basic syntax](https://atonix0.github.io/Atomic-Script/docs/basic_syntax) for more detalied view

- another optional(enabled for dev, disabled for people who just want scripts for peformance) phase for type-checking & more

# trying atomic:
simply use the command in your terminal ```deno run main.ts``` to enter repl mode
(make sure you have deno installed and to exit press ```ctrl+c``` in your terminal)
or if you to read a file use ```deno run --allow-read main.ts run {file}``` or pass this args using your debugger
and if you want to test it for dev reasons ```deno run --allow-read main.ts run? {file}```

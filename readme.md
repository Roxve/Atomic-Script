# Atomic-Script

Atomic-Script is a simple small dynamic scripting language made for fun! built-on c#
#### warning yes i know my code is shit this isn't a serious job or something please don't hate ðŸ¥³

# Features:
### this is list of avaliable features to help me on dev go to [website](atonix0.github.io/Atomic-Script) for overview, or to [basic syntax](atonix0.github.io/Atomic-Script/docs/basic_syntax) for more detalied view


# Features(i want):

- full basic working programming lang c# typescript golang f#(less to do more) inspired syntax

# TODO(next update):
- make a website for the language as it's going tough it's early usable stage faster than i tough
# trying atomic:
simply use the command in your terminal ```dotnet run``` to enter repl mode
(make sure you have dotnet-sdk installed and to exit press ```ctrl+c``` in your terminal)
or if you to read a file use ```dotnet run run {file}``` or pass this args using your debugger
and if you want to test it for dev reasons ```dotnet run run? {file}``` 
### if you are using a debugger and getting an error give invalid args (in vscode you can go to .vscode/launch.json and change ```args=[]``` to args=["random"]) (this is a bug i am too lazy to fix)

# license:

i don't know about this atuff but you can use the code as long as you inform me and give me credits i guess
